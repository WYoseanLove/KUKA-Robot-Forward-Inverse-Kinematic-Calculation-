KUKA_Robot_Kinematic_Calculation used to calculate the KUKA 6 DOF Industrial Robot forward Kinematic and inverse Kinematic.
From the class you can given input J1-J6 joint degree for KUKA Robot and will auto calculate the end effector posture, and same if you give the end effector posture, you can get the J1-J6 JOINT  degree for all the possible solutions.
The calculation is base on c++ Eigen Library, and all the calculation is deducted from J1 until J6.

Usage:          KUKA 6 DOF Industrial Robot forward Kinematic and inverse Kinematic, can be modified to other industry robot like ABB, FANUC and Kawasaki
